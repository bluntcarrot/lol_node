LoL web app

This web application uses JSON data that it retrieves from a third party API to allow you to search through the League of Legends champions. Features that I plan to add in the near future include: easily query champions by combat style/name/specific stats, compare champions side by side, user lookup/search that can give individual stats and more as I continue to work on this project.
